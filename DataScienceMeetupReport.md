## Springboard Data Science Meetup Report
#### Meetup Attended : Palo Alto machine Learning and Deep Learning Meetup 
#### Date            : 12/15/2017
#### Venue           : 425 National Ave., Mountain View, CA
#### Speaker         : Mr. Sudhir Wadhwa, Founding Chief Technology Officer at Viridis
####                   Adjunct Lecturer, Leavey School of Business, anta Clara University

This was a Meetup helpd on Dec . 15th, 2017. The speaker was Prof. Sudhir Wadhwa. He cope on 
Movie Recommender system using KNN alssification. The Meetup was well attended - there were 50 attendees or more.
The sponsor was Wipro technologies. There was time to meet several attendees. There were professsionals as well as aspiring attndees.
The talk began with an introduction by organizers on the objective of the meetup : to make available lectures such as these for free to disseminate knowledge of the Data Science. The sponsors Wipro technologies also spoke welcoming the audience and how Wipro is also building solutions using ML and AI. 

Professor Wadhwa began by polling the audience on how many people wee familiar with Machine learning. There were 10% of the audience that was completely new to ML. There was  a short introduction to Statistical learning - How it differs from Programming in that one does not have to implement an algorithm, but one has to draw upon one's experience to evaluate which ML algorithm from a library  is used for tackling a ML Problem. Nest he explained about ETL, traing and test data sets, selecting features, selecting models based on error metrics and finally prediction based on the most accurate model

The talk on movie recommendation was a a live program walk through using Jupyter notebook. It was fun as I was familiar enough to download the data-set at the venue, open Jupyternote book and implement the Movie recommendation system based on MovieLens Data set. It had 100K observations on both User and Movie data. User-User recommendation  was explained. Item-Item recommendation was discussed. Measures of Similarity using 
1. Euclidean distance
2. Cosine distance
3. Pearson distance was discussed.

I posed a question on their difference and my main take away was that the Pearson distance method was most accurate. Although, the code walk through was rushed, I discussed with attendeeds and made people-people connections. In the end I connected witht he speaer on LinkedIn and added a 2 other people to my Network
